<p>Today marks the launch of Martian Potato, an idle game that's perhaps a bit too honest about how it works.</p>
<p>You'll start by clicking to plant potatoes on Mars. Simple enough. But as you progress from manual farming to quantum technology, the game will explain exactly how it's manipulating you to keep playing.</p>
<p>What's included in this initial release:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Resource management (water, nutrients, ice)</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Technology progression from basic tools to quantum computers</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Multiple automation systems</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Meta-commentary on game design psychology</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Achievement system that questions why you care about achievements</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Real-time resource monitoring</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ A surprising amount of potato-based philosophy</p>
<p>The game is completely free (or pay what you want), playable in your browser, and saves automatically. No need to babysit your potatoes.</p>
<p>Fair warning: This game knows what it's doing to your dopamine levels. It will tell you about it. You'll probably keep playing anyway.</p>
