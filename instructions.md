## Getting Started

Welcome to Martian Potato! In this game, you'll be pioneering potato farming on Mars, using advanced technology and strategy to build a thriving potato empire.

### Basic Controls
- Click the "Plant Potato" button to plant your first potato
- Click on fully grown potatoes (100%) to harvest them
- Watch your resources (Water, Ice, Nutrients) - you'll need them to plant potatoes

### Your First Steps
1. Start by planting your first potato using the "Plant Potato" button
2. While it grows, explore Mars to gather more resources
3. Harvest your potato when it reaches 100% growth
4. Use your harvested potatoes to unlock new features and upgrades

## Core Mechanics

### Resource Management
- **Water**: Essential for potato growth
- **Ice**: Can be melted into water
- **Nutrients**: Required for healthy potato growth
- **Potatoes**: Your main currency for upgrades

### Growth System
- Potatoes take time to grow from 0% to 100%
- Growth speed can be improved through upgrades
- Fully grown potatoes pulse with a golden glow
- Harvest potatoes at 100% to collect them

### Basic Tools
- **Manual Ice Melting**: Click to convert ice into water
- **Ice Melting Basin**: Automated ice-to-water conversion
