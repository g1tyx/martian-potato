    - [ ] Upgrade Milestones:
        - [ ] "Tech Savvy": Purchase your first 5 upgrades
            - Asset: tech_savvy.webp
            - Prompt: "A Martian control room with holographic displays showing various potato farming technologies. An astronaut's hand activates the 5th upgrade, causing the room to glow with achievement. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
        - [ ] "Martian Engineer": Unlock all upgrades
            - Asset: martian_engineer.webp
            - Prompt: "An astronaut wearing an augmented reality headset, surrounded by floating holograms of potato farming equipment and upgrades. All holograms in one category are lit up, indicating completion. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
    - [ ] Time-based Achievements:
        - [ ] "One Sol Wonder": Play the game continuously for 1 Martian day (24 hours and 37 minutes)
            - Asset: one_sol_wonder.webp
            - Prompt: "A split-screen showing a Martian day cycle: one half in daylight, the other in Martian night. A potato plant grows progressively across the image. A clock face overlaid shows 24:37. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
    - [ ] Other Achievements:
        - [ ] "Potato Empire": Have 1000 potatoes, 1000 water, 1000 soil nutrients, and 1000 oxygen simultaneously
            - Asset: potato_empire.webp
            - Prompt: "A grand Martian citadel made entirely of interconnected potato-shaped domes. Each dome represents a resource: potatoes, water, nutrients, and oxygen. Holographic '1000' floats above each dome. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"

Bugs/Issues:
- [x] The blur on the tech tree is reappearing on load even after a level 10 upgrade is purchased
- [x] Manual exploration should reward no water and twice as much ice as nutrients since ice is melted into water and we want to encourage that action without ice going to 0 to use the nutrients gained from exploration
- [x] Reduce initial planting delay from 5 to 3 seconds, and adjust the upgrades to match
- [x] clicking tech tree cards should open the modal not try to purchase the upgrade
- [x] increase weight of thermal drill by 5
- [x] disabled action cards should not have a click effect
- [x] increase cost of potato genome modification by 50 potatoes
- [x] remove ice melting acheivments
    - [x] iceMeltingBasinMaster
    - [x] nuclearIceMelterMaster
- [x] reduce cost of jetpack to 200 potatoes
- [x] remove the ice 2x multiple for manual exploration
- [x] potato century achievent should be based on cumulative total, not just current count
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Currently the fully upgraded game consumes more than one potato to produce one potato, we need to make it positive so that the game is sustainable. Unlocked tech should consume different resources if possible, not always just potatoes, and we should reward more of each resource.
