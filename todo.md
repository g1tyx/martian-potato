--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Consider making nuclear ice melter melt 5% of available ice resource instead fo a fixed amount
    - [ ] Or even consider allowing the player to adjust the percentage
    - [ ] Consider adding a startup sequence for the reactor that shows the amount of potatoes that will be consumed on startup and the amount of ice that will be melted per second, making the action card double-width
- [ ] Style the toggle switches to match the specific resource generated
- [ ] Write real meta messages and descriptions
- [ ] Add production stats
- [ ] Add cumulative potato stats to graph modal
- [ ] Balance upgrade costs and effects
- [ ] Add new achievements:
    - [ ] Upgrade Milestones:
        - [ ] "Tech Savvy": Purchase your first 5 upgrades
            - Asset: tech_savvy.webp
            - Prompt: "A Martian control room with holographic displays showing various potato farming technologies. An astronaut's hand activates the 5th upgrade, causing the room to glow with achievement. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
        - [ ] "Martian Engineer": Unlock all upgrades
            - Asset: martian_engineer.webp
            - Prompt: "An astronaut wearing an augmented reality headset, surrounded by floating holograms of potato farming equipment and upgrades. All holograms in one category are lit up, indicating completion. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
    - [ ] Time-based Achievements:
        - [ ] "One Sol Wonder": Play the game continuously for 1 Martian day (24 hours and 37 minutes)
            - Asset: one_sol_wonder.webp
            - Prompt: "A split-screen showing a Martian day cycle: one half in daylight, the other in Martian night. A potato plant grows progressively across the image. A clock face overlaid shows 24:37. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
    - [ ] Other Achievements:
        - [ ] "Potato Empire": Have 1000 potatoes, 1000 water, 1000 soil nutrients, and 1000 oxygen simultaneously
            - Asset: potato_empire.webp
            - Prompt: "A grand Martian citadel made entirely of interconnected potato-shaped domes. Each dome represents a resource: potatoes, water, nutrients, and oxygen. Holographic '1000' floats above each dome. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"

Bugs/Issues:
- [x] The blur on the tech tree is reappearing on load even after a level 10 upgrade is purchased
- [x] Manual exploration should reward no water and twice as much ice as nutrients since ice is melted into water and we want to encourage that action without ice going to 0 to use the nutrients gained from exploration
- [x] Reduce initial planting delay from 5 to 3 seconds, and adjust the upgrades to match
- [x] clicking tech tree cards should open the modal not try to purchase the upgrade
- [x] increase weight of thermal drill by 5
- [x] disabled action cards should not have a click effect
- [x] increase cost of potato genome modification by 50 potatoes
- [x] remove ice melting acheivments
    - [x] iceMeltingBasinMaster
    - [x] nuclearIceMelterMaster
- [x] reduce cost of jetpack to 200 potatoes
- [x] remove the ice 2x multiple for manual exploration
- [x] potato century achievent should be based on cumulative total, not just current count
- [x] The last milestone tech cards arent being removed
- [x] Subterrarean tunneler starts generating resources right away, even before it is turned on with the toggle switch
- [x] Exploration bonus doesnt seem to be increasing (or maybe its not persistent between loads)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Currently the fully upgraded game consumes more than one potato to produce one potato, we need to make it positive so that the game is sustainable. Unlocked tech should consume different resources if possible, not always just potatoes, and we should reward more of each resource.
- [ ] Logic for removing graph datapoints when there are too many is bad
- [ ] Some action cards disappear when the quantum spud spawner is unlocked
- [ ] Toasts about exploration rates changing are showing every load instead of just when the upgrade is purchased
