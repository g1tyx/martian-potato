    - [ ] Upgrade Milestones:
        - [ ] "Tech Savvy": Purchase your first 5 upgrades
            - Asset: tech_savvy.webp
            - Prompt: "A Martian control room with holographic displays showing various potato farming technologies. An astronaut's hand activates the 5th upgrade, causing the room to glow with achievement. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
        - [ ] "Martian Engineer": Unlock all upgrades
            - Asset: martian_engineer.webp
            - Prompt: "An astronaut wearing an augmented reality headset, surrounded by floating holograms of potato farming equipment and upgrades. All holograms in one category are lit up, indicating completion. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
    - [ ] Time-based Achievements:
        - [ ] "One Sol Wonder": Play the game continuously for 1 Martian day (24 hours and 37 minutes)
            - Asset: one_sol_wonder.webp
            - Prompt: "A split-screen showing a Martian day cycle: one half in daylight, the other in Martian night. A potato plant grows progressively across the image. A clock face overlaid shows 24:37. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
        - [ ] "Week on Mars": Accumulate 7 days of total play time
            - Asset: week_on_mars.webp
            - Prompt: "Seven potato plants in a row, each representing a day of growth on Mars. The background transitions from a newly established base to a thriving potato farm. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"
    - [ ] Other Achievements:
        - [ ] "Potato Empire": Have 1000 potatoes, 1000 water, 1000 soil nutrients, and 1000 oxygen simultaneously
            - Asset: potato_empire.webp
            - Prompt: "A grand Martian citadel made entirely of interconnected potato-shaped domes. Each dome represents a resource: potatoes, water, nutrients, and oxygen. Holographic '1000' floats above each dome. Hyper-realistic rendering, low-poly. --ar 1:1 --v 6 --q 4"

Bugs/Issues:
- [x] The blur on the tech tree is reappearing on load even after a level 10 upgrade is purchased
- [ ] Manual exploration should reward no water and twice as much ice as nutrients since ice is melted into water and we want to encourage that action without ice going to 0 to use the nutrients gained from exploration
- [ ] Reduce initial planting delay from 5 to 3 seconds, and adjust the upgrades to match
