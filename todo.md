--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Add production stats
- [ ] Balance upgrade costs and effects
- [ ] Mobile styling
- [ ] Add potato sentience upgrade effect



Bugs/Issues:
- [x] The blur on the tech tree is reappearing on load even after a level 10 upgrade is purchased
- [x] Manual exploration should reward no water and twice as much ice as nutrients since ice is melted into water and we want to encourage that action without ice going to 0 to use the nutrients gained from exploration
- [x] Reduce initial planting delay from 5 to 3 seconds, and adjust the upgrades to match
- [x] clicking tech tree cards should open the modal not try to purchase the upgrade
- [x] increase weight of thermal drill by 5
- [x] disabled action cards should not have a click effect
- [x] increase cost of potato genome modification by 50 potatoes
- [x] remove ice melting acheivments
    - [x] iceMeltingBasinMaster
    - [x] nuclearIceMelterMaster
- [x] reduce cost of jetpack to 200 potatoes
- [x] remove the ice 2x multiple for manual exploration
- [x] potato century achievent should be based on cumulative total, not just current count
- [x] The last milestone tech cards arent being removed
- [x] Subterrarean tunneler starts generating resources right away, even before it is turned on with the toggle switch
- [x] Exploration bonus doesnt seem to be increasing (or maybe its not persistent between loads)
- [x] Toasts about exploration rates changing are showing every load instead of just when the upgrade is purchased
- [x] move potato colonizer to right of spud spawner
- [x] make the spud spawner faster
- [x] Currently the fully upgraded game consumes more than one potato to produce one potato, we need to make it positive so that the game is sustainable. Unlocked tech should consume different resources if possible, not always just potatoes, and we should reward more of each resource.
- [x] Subsurface Aquifer Tapper is not working after loading from save
- [x] Logic for removing graph datapoints when there are too many is broken
- [x] Bucket wheel excavator and subterranean tunneler do not generate resources after refreshing the game / loading the game from a save
- [x] Unlocking the nuclear ice melter hides the Subsurface aquifer tapper and polar cap mining action cards... which appear again on refresh
- [x] Refreshing the page / loading the game from a save changes the order of the technology upgrades. I noticed ice melting basin goes from like 4th to 12th or something, higher that some of the much higher tier upgrades. It should be sorted by tier though... so this should not be happening.
- [x] Unlocking all tech doesn't show the achievement
- [x] Potato spots can appear over the growth indicator percentage
- [x] Buttons dont have convincing click effects because they move a bit
- [x] Auto Harvester should be relabeled Autonomous Harvesting Rover, Automated Planter should be relabeled Autonomous Planting Rover. In production stats it should be abbreviated as Planting Rovers and Harvesting Rovers.
- [x] Martian map reduces exploration time by too much
- [x] Reduce weight of ice melting basin to make it more visible in the tech tree
- [x] Polar cap mining should consume only 1 potato not 2, and should generate 4 ice not 2
- [x] Gravitropism upgrade cost increase from 250 to 1000
